# Chrome-Extension
The YouTube Auto Pause Play Extension is a browser add-on designed to enhance your video-watching experience by automatically pausing playback when you navigate away from the YouTube tab. This extension helps prevent videos from continuing to play in the background, saving data and avoiding interruptions. Ideal for users who frequently switch between tabs or multitask, it ensures that you only watch content when you're actively engaged. With customizable settings, you can tailor the extension to fit your preferences, making it a convenient tool for a more controlled and seamless viewing experience.
